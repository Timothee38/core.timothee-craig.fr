# timothee-craig.fr API

Reworking my personal website using more recent technologies. 
There will be a front-end, visible to all user and a back-end, only for me.

The front-end will be quite similar to what it is right now, but it would be loading dynamically.
As for the back-end, I'm going to create an admin.timothee-craig.fr from which I can edit the data of my website easily, and monitor the amount of visitors, etc.

The application will also use a REST API, which is this project. It uses JWT for authentication.
